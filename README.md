# jsd-final

The idea of this website is to help people who are looking for an university for study or work with.
The website provides detailed information about the url of the university and country location.
For country location, the websie also searches for all the related news and provides news url.

However, the website works for country search sometimes and doesn't sometimes. This is what I needs to study further. Also, the CSS part needs to be improved so that the serached information can be displayed/arranged in a more friendly way.

The best outcome of this final project is that I learend how to use API to create a website.
